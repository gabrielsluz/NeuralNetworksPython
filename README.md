This repository contains neural networks implemented in Python to help me to better understand the concepts.
It is divided in Jupyter Notebooks that run the algorithms implemented in the python files. There are specific python files, such as logistic_regression.py and vanilla_neural_networks.py, and shared ones, such as activation_functions.py and weigth_initalizations.py.

It implements the following algorithms:

-Logistic Regression (logistic_regression.py)

-A Neural Network for binary classification (vanilla_neural_networks.py)

-A Neural Network with an softmax output layer (softmax_neural_networks.py)
